### Overview

A sophisticated twist on the classic Roman carbonara that respects the authentic technique while incorporating premium ingredients. This recipe maintains the silky, egg-and-cheese emulsion that defines true carbonara, enhanced with tender beef sirloin and fresh asparagus for a perfect balance of richness and freshness.

### Recipe

**Prep time:** ~15 minutes

**Cooking time:** ~20 minutes

**Complexity:** Medium

#### Ingredients (2 portions)

##### Main Dish

*   200g Fresh tagliatelle (raw weight)
*   150g Beef sirloin (trimmed, cut into small bite-size cubes or thin strips)
*   70g Pancetta (cut into matchsticks/lardons)
*   120g Frozen asparagus spears (about 6–8 spears), thawed and cut into 2–3 cm pieces
*   60g Parmigiano Reggiano (finely grated, plus extra for finishing)
*   2 large egg yolks + 1 whole egg
*   15g Butter (about 1 tbsp)
*   Freshly cracked black pepper (generous amount)
*   Salt (to taste)

### Preparation

#### 1. Sauce Base (prepare before cooking pasta)

In a bowl, combine:
*   2 egg yolks + 1 whole egg
*   50g grated Parmigiano Reggiano
*   1 generous teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper

Whisk into a thick paste-like sauce and reserve.

#### 2. Pancetta & Asparagus

1.  In a large pan over medium heat, render pancetta slowly until crisp and fat has melted.
2.  Remove pancetta with a slotted spoon and set aside.
3.  In the rendered fat, add asparagus pieces and sauté for 2–3 minutes until just tender and slightly caramelized.
4.  Remove asparagus and set aside with pancetta.

#### 3. Beef Sirloin

1.  Increase heat slightly and add butter (plus a touch of oil if needed).
2.  Quickly sear sirloin pieces until just browned outside but still pink inside (they will cook a touch more later).
3.  Season lightly with salt & pepper.
4.  Remove and set aside with pancetta and asparagus.

#### 4. Cook Pasta

1.  Bring water to boil and season well with salt (like the sea).
2.  Drop in tagliatelle and cook for 2 minutes.
3.  Reserve about 1 mug of pasta water.
4.  Drain pasta.

#### 5. Combine (Carbonara-style)

1.  Return hot pasta to the pan (off the heat!) together with pancetta, asparagus, and beef.
2.  Add egg–cheese mixture and toss quickly.
3.  Splash in reserved hot pasta water gradually until creamy and glossy.
4.  The residual heat cooks the eggs into a sauce without scrambling.
5.  Aim for a silky coating that coats the pasta beautifully.

#### 6. Adjust & Serve

1.  Taste and adjust with more black pepper and Parmigiano.
2.  Finish with a very light drizzle of olive oil (optional) or a shaving of cheese.
3.  Serve immediately while hot and creamy.

### Flavor Balance Tips

*   **Keep beef portions small** - they should complement, not dominate. The pancetta and sauce remain central to the "carbonara identity."
*   **Be generous with black pepper** - this is a carbonara hallmark.
*   **Don't overcook asparagus** - a touch of freshness/lightness is important since beef + pancetta + egg/cheese can get heavy.
*   **Keep sauce loose** - add pasta water gradually to prevent clumping and achieve the perfect creamy texture.

### The Carbonara Technique

This recipe maintains the authentic carbonara method:
*   **No cream** - the sauce is purely egg-and-cheese based
*   **Pasta water emulsion** - creates the silky texture
*   **Residual heat cooking** - prevents scrambled eggs
*   **Generous black pepper** - essential for authentic flavor

The result is a sophisticated dish that honors the Roman tradition while offering a modern twist with premium ingredients.
