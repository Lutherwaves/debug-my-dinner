<div style="text-align: left">## Overview</div>

A spectacular way of cooking a plain piece of meat. A savory, fatty, and moist boneless pork roast of Italian cooking tradition This is a simpler and smaller way of bringing the Italian tradition to the home table. Serve it at dinner gatherings, and if you go the extra mile of doing it over char-coal, you will get a crispy, smoky, juicy centerpiece for your friends or family.

## Recipe

*   Prep time \~ 2 days

*   Cooking time \~ 2.5h

*   Complexity: **Medium**

### Ingredients

#### Main dish

Keeping it simple and not too spicy, feel free to tweak the dry spices to fit your taste.

*   \~ 1.5 - 2kg Pork belly fat with skin (or pork back)

*   \~ 1.5 - 2kg Pork Loin

*   2  - White onions

*   200g - Creamy Yogurt (10% fat at least)

*   1 tsp. Salt

*   1 tsp. Ground pepper

*   2 tbsp. Mustard powder

#### Sauce

Simple basic veloute sauce, nothing fancy.

*   50 g butter

*   50 g flour

*   1 tbsp. dijon mustard

*   300ml beef stock (concentrated)

#### Side dish

Simple potato mash

*   1kg Potatoes

*   50g Butter

*   50 ml Milk

### Prep the meat

We need to prep the meat, so that each piece fits into the other.

1.  Lay the pork belly flat on a countertop, skin side up. Using a fork, make as many punctures in the skin as your patience allows. I like to use a [needle meat tenderizer](https://www.amazon.com/Meat-Tenderizer-Tool/s?k=Meat+Tenderizer+Tool). The more punctures, the crispier the skin once it hits the fire.
2.  Turn the pork around skin side down. Depending on the piece of meat you have, you might need to trim some fat, but the important thing is that it is even. Using a very sharp long knife, make an incision on the side of the piece, between the skin and the fat. We're going to separate the fat from the skin, but will leave the fat attached to the piece of skin. Be careful during this step not to puncture the skin. You should be left with a piece of fat/meat on the top of the skin, that you can roll separately from the skin, but is still attached to the piece.
3.  Turn the piece around again and rub coarse sea salt to the skin, massaging the salt so it penetrates in the holes. Lay flat skin side up on a drying rack and put it in the fridge at least overnight. This will help the skin dry out and become extra crispy later.
4.  Grab your pork loin and remove all the silver skin using a sharp knife.
5.  We now need to butterfly the pork loin. Make an incision along side of the piece, leaving around 1 cm of meat on the outer side. Do not slice through the meat, but stop at around 2cm before you slice through. Roll it the meat so that your slice is on the top, then repeat slicing 1cm away from the bottom until you have a flat piece of meat.
6.  Cover the meat with plastic wrap, then using a meat hammer, make sure it is evenly thick across the whole piece.
7.  Cut and trim the piece, so that it is only slightly smaller than your belly pork piece, but not by more than 2cm.
8.  Rub salt on both sides of the meat, then put on a drying rack and leave in the fridge to dry with your pork belly

### Roll it up

We are now ready to spread the marinade on the meat and roll it up.

1.  In a bowl, grate the onions to extract the most flavor. Remove any remainders or big pieces, as we want the marinade to be consistent.

2.  Add the yogurt and dry spices, then mix it up well. It should be slightly yellow from the mustard powder, unless you modified the dry spices to your taste.

3.  Take your butterflied loin out and spread the marinade in a thin layer over the meat. You want to have the meat covered up, but not soaking in marinade.

4.  On the fat side of the pork belly, spread some of the marinade on the sides that will not touch the loin.

5.  Put the loin piece on top of the unwrapped pork belly fat. Roll up the pork fat onto the sirloin, so that the fat mixes with the loin when it rolls.

6.  Once you roll it up to the edge of the pork belly, roll the pork belly in the opposite direction to form the final Porchetta wrap.

7.  Tie the piece using [butcher's knot](https://youtu.be/fPu1EhGbFzM?si=WUTji_pXxy6KSliv). Wrap both ends first, then the middle. Do not over tighten, but make sure the roll is tight and stays together well as a whole. I recommend laying out the knots in such a way, so that when you cut afterwards, each can be a piece to serve.

### Fire!

#### Porchetta Roast

It's time for the magic. I recommend doing this over charcoal to add some smoke flavor, but you can also do it in the oven.

1.  Heat up your charcoal to a high temp and setup your grill in such a way that the heat hits the meat from one side. The juices from the porchetta may cause flare-up that will burn the skin and prevent it from crisping up. You can also pierce the meat on a rotisserie, which I recommend for the best even roast.

2.  Make sure you hit the pork skin at your highest temp (260 C<sup>o</sup>/ 500 F) for at least 35 minutes. If in the oven, place the skin on a rack so that the most skin is exposed and not touching the base. You should see the outside of the skin start to sweat and crisp up.

3.  Reduce the temperature to 150 C<sup>o</sup> / 300 F and bake until you reach an internal temperature between 65 C<sup>o</sup> / 150 F and 70 C<sup>o</sup> / 160 F. (Turn around so that the heat hits different sides of the dish every 30 minutes if you are not using rotisserie)

4.  Once it is ready, leave it outside on a drying rack to cool down and rest for at least 20 minutes. Do not cover so that the skin remains crispy.

#### Side dish

I like to lay my porchetta slices on fluffy potato mash, but the dish goes well with other side dishes.

1.  Peel and slice your potatoes into even pieces.

2.  Put them in a pot of cold water, add a sprinkle of salt (to increase the boiling temp of the water).

3.  On medium to high heat, let the water start boiling.

4.  Once it boiled for 2-3 minutes, replace the hot water with cold water and put them back on the stove.

5.  Once the water is boiling again, reduce the heat to low, then simmer the potatoes until fork tender.

6.  Once ready, discard the water and leave the potatoes in the pot. Mash the potatoes using a fork, or go fancy with a potato ricer.

7.  Once your potatoes are mashed up, add your butter, salt and your milk, and put the pot on the stove, very low heat.

8.  Using a large wooden spoon, make sure you mix the potato mash together well so that it becomes fluffy.

9.  Do not forget to add salt to taste.

#### Sauce

1.  Melt your butter in a small casserole on medium heat. Do not let it burn, but just brown a tiny bit.

2.  Add your white flour into the pan and mix well, so the mixture becomes sort of like a paste or wet sand. This is called a roux.

3.  Mix well and start adding your warm stock, do not add too much stock at a time.

4.  Repeat adding stock and mixing until your sauce is liquid, but stays on the back of the spoon.

5.  At this point, your sauce should be velvety brown.

6.  Put your sauce off the heat and let it cool down for a few minutes.

7.  Add the mustard into the sauce and mix it up well.

8.  If you have any lumps, just sift your sauce through a sieve to dissolve them.

### Serve

1.  Remove all the knots from the porchetta wrap.

2.  Using a bread knife, slice your pieces at 2cm width.

3.  Put 2 tbsp of mash on your plate, then place the slice on top of it.

4.  Put sauce around your potato mash, so it doesn't soak up the crispy pork skin.

5.  Enjoy!
