Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. That is if you have the equipment. But since you're here, you like don't, so follow this recipe to get the same results using plain home equipment.\n\n## Recipe\n\n*   Prep time - 1 day\n\n*   Cooking time - 20 minutes\n\n*   Complexity: **Low**\n\n### Ingredients\n\nKeeping it simple and not too spicy, feel free to tweak the dry spices to fit your taste.\n\n*   \\~ 500 g lamb meat (not too lean)\n\n*   \\~ 500 g beef meat (or large mince also works, not too lean)\n\n*   1 large white onion\n\n*   1 tsp Nutmeg\n\n*   1 tbsp white pepper\n\n*   1 tbsp black pepper\n\n*   2 tbsp salt\n\n*   *   *   1 fresh tomato*   1 fresh cucumber*   1 large red onion\n\n### Preparation\n\n#### Meat\n\n1.  Grate your white onion and mix it with the dry ingredients. Split the mixture in two equal portions.\n\n2.  Slice your pork and lamb meat into the thinnest possible slices against the grain.\n\n3.  Season the pork and lamb (separately) with the respective part of the white onion and spices mix.\n\n4.  In a square tupperware (that will fit all the meat), place a layer of the pork on the bottom, then cover with lamb. Make sure you have a thin layer of meat on top of meat. Use all the meat until your tupperware is full\n\n5.  Leave in the fridge overnight, or at least for 12 hours to marinate.\n\n6.  Once done, move the mixture to the freezer.\n\n7.  Once frozen, if you intend to keep the mixture for longer, you can move it out of the tupperware and slice it into portions to fit your doner needs. Then vacuum and store indefinitely.\n\n#### Garnish\n\n1.  Slice your red onion in half, then into thin half-moons. Put it into a bowl, then season with salt and add a tbsp of vinegar on top. Mix well and leave to marinate.\n\n2.  Slice your cucumbers into thin circles.\n\n3.  Slice your tomato into thin circles.\n\n4.  Prepare your lavash or tortilla bread for roasting.\n\n## Fire!\n\n1.  Once your meat is frozen thorougly, move it out of the freezer and prepare for cooking.\n\n2.  Heat up a cast iron plate or pan, and place your \"meatloaf\" on a cutting board close to the heat.\n\n3.  Cut thin slices of the meat and place right onto the heat. Don't flip or do anything, just leave them to brown on one side for at least 5 minutes or until the side hitting the pan reaches a nice color.\n\n4.  Once browned, remove from the heat and keep warm.\n\n5.  Repeat until you have cooked through all the meat.\n\n## Serve\n\n1.  In a heated pan, toast your tortilla/lavash bread for a 30 seconds or until warm\n\n2.  In the middle, place a tbsp of greek yoghurt.\n\n3.  Put a few slices of marinated onions, cucumbers and tomato.\n\n4.  Put some of the cooked meat on top.\n\n5.  Roll the wrap up and pull back the filling. Then close the sides, and finish rolling.\n\n6.  Put into a baking paper or parchment paper, and roll it up fully, closing the sides tightly.\n\n7.  Slice in half and serve, enjoy while it is still warm!\n\n##\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left\"></div>\n\n"
